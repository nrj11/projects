/* these projects are a collection of my work thus far in my computer science courses in university. The bar chart and chart object both model data in
a bar chart and the chart object uses object oriented programming to display a bar chart using the C++ SFML library. */

/* the breakout is a pseudo-Brickbreaker game that also utilizes the C++ SFML library. Utilizing moving graphics, I recreated the beloved game --
using a paddle, the user is intended to bounce a ball onto each brick in order to eliminate the bricks from the screen. The paddles are moved using the 
keyboard arrow keys, and the game ends if the ball moves off the screen. */

/* the .zip entitled "nrj11P2" is a more recent project, utilizing OOP and polymorphism to create a comprehensive organizational tool
for the inventory of a public library. Using the class member functions, a library would be able to organize their inventory, check out and check in
materials, search for a specific title, author, or borrower, and other functions. */
